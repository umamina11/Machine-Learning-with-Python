Linear regression 
linear regression is one of the most basic form of machine learning and is 
used to predic the numeric values


Matplotlib for prinitng graphs 
Regression we can develop a line of best fit 
through these datapoints that can accuraetly classify 
and using these lines we can predict accurately 
we can explain line of best fit as a line through a scatter plot of data points
that best expresses the relationship between those points  .

        |
        |(x,y)   /------------> best fit line
        |   .   /.
        |   .  /   .
        |    ./.
        |    /  .
        |   /.
        | ./
     b  | /

2-D to make prediction when we have one factor 
y=mx+b

line must have all the points closed to the line and split even- equally


numpy : allow multidimesnional calculation and respresntation
pandas: data analytics tools, allow to manipulate the datasets
Matplotlib: allow to  genreate graphs and other mathematical visuals
Ipython: specific to output
