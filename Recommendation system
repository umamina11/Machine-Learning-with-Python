Lets takes the example of netflix 
which wants to provide the user recommendation of the movies from their watch history 
there are many kind of machine learning models that provides the recommendation systems 
- based on classification
- based on association 
- based on deep learning 
- based on popularity 
and many more....

Collaborative filtering 
where different users have different opnions and then if they have similar choices so they have similar recommendaiton that means 
here we have used the similarity 
here we used the recommendaiton for one user to another as they have similarity in their choices 
this is unsupervised learning where the machine learn from dataset and find its own pattern and make predictions based on that learning.

MACHINE LEARNING ON CLOUD

cloud computing has made is very easy to perfrom machine learning 
it allow the data collection from differnt soruces and variety of data

differnt cloud service provides, 
- AWS 
- AZure

and many more
