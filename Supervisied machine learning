The supervised leanring models has a set of input varibles let say X
and an putput variable say Y, And algorithm identifies the mapping function between the input and 
the output variables
the relationship is Y=f(X)

Regression and classififcation are the types of supervised learning.

It used the labeled data to train the machine and then test datsset to test or 
evaluate the model effectiency as they are able to perfrom what the developer 
feed the machine.

there are differnt types of labeling and on that the type of supervised learning depends 

Regression and classification 
Regression: is a mehtod of modeling a traget value is based on independent predictors
it mainly works on the numeric data

it is a stastical tool which is used to find out the relationship between the outcome 
variable also known as dependent varibale and one or more varible often 
called as independent varibales 
Dependent varible are those whose values depend on independent variable 
like rent of room depends on the number of rooms provided or used 

Classification 
It is the process of taking various labels to train the algorithm to identify items within a 
specific category
