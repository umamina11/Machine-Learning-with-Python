Introduction to TensorFlow

A tensor flow is a generation of vectors and matrics to potential higher 
dimensions, interanally tensor flow represent tensor as n- dimensional array of base datatypes 

Vector : a data point, it cn have n- number of dimensions as per the requirements

Tensor main object we are workking with maniplation and viewing 

Datatype : what type of informaiton stored in (integre, string, float)
Shape : representaion the dimesnion of data (scaler(just one value), materics)

Rank / Degree of Tensors
simply mean number of dimensions involved in the tensor 

Example 

rank_0=tf.Variable("this is a string",tf.string)----or we call it scalar 
as it is simply one this there is no dimernison 

rank_1=tf.Variable(["test],tf.string).
here this is an array which can store multiple values so we call it one list or one rank

rank_2=tf.Variable([["test","ok"],["test","yes"]],tf.string)
this we call 2 as here we have list inside a list or we call a matrix so this will give us 
rank 2 


To determine rank of tensor
tf.rank(rank1_tesnor)

Shapes of tensor 
It tells how many items we have as in numbers 

syntax: rank_2.shape

Changing Shape 

The nubmer of the elements of a tensor is the prouct of the sixes of all 
its shapes. There are often many shapes that have the same number of 
elements, making it convient to be able to change th shape of a tensor 

Example:
tensor1=tf.ones([1,2,3])   # shape of one 

 1 list 
 inside which we have 2 lists and each have 3 lists

tensor2=tf.reshape(tensor1,[2,3,1])   # reshaping the existing data to shape

tensor3=tf.reshape(tensor2,[3,-1])   # here the -1 will tells the tensor 
to calculate the size of the dimensions in that place this will 
reshape the tensor to [3,2]

print(tensor1)    #printing tensor to compare
print(tensor2)
print(tensor3)

TYPES OF Tensors
- Variable
- constant
- placeholder
- sparse tnesor     
few others
