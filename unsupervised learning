Unsupervised learning
when the purpose of the algorithm goes unclear that goes with unsuepervise learning 
has many more styles as it doesnot have any label to work on
important unsupervised learning problems
clustering: this means bundling the inpur variables with the same characterisitics together 
grouping with similarities.
we need to find features and small distances

Association, here the rules that govern meaningful association among the data set. 
eg: where one and the other thing is related to each other and have relations or conections

it is effective looking at data withot looking at specific feature or rule.
it finds those relations and fetures themselves

It is a pattern discovery task 
that sometimes lead to prediction (undertimined)
